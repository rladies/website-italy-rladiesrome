[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) began as a meetup group in San Francisco in 2012 when `Gabriela de Queiroz` founded the first chapter and organized the first event. Over the next three years, three more groups started following this example. After the useR! conference in 2016, where Gabriela and other organizers met in person, `R-Ladies Global` was co-founded by several active community members. Since then, the organization has experienced massive and rapid growth, with the number of R-Ladies chapters increasing significantly. Today, R-Ladies has 219 chapters in 63 countries and over 3943 events contributing to promote gender diversity in the `R community`.
