[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) began as a meetup group in San Francisco in 2012 when `Gabriela de Queiroz` founded the first chapter and organized the first event. Over the next three years, three more groups started following this example. After the useR! conference in 2016, where Gabriela and other organizers met in person, `R-Ladies Global` was co-founded by several active community members. Since then, the organization has experienced massive and rapid growth, with the number of R-Ladies chapters increasing significantly. Today, R-Ladies has 219 chapters in 63 countries and over 3943 events contributing to promote gender diversity in the `R community`.

[Federica Gazzelloni](https://federicagazzelloni.netlify.app/) Lead Organizer. I am an independent researcher passionate about data science, with a background in actuarial statistics and expertise in collaborative environments. My journey extends from traditional actuarial work using Excel to advanced data science with R.

[Silvana Acosta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silacos/) Organizer. I am a Senior Data Scientist with six years of experience from tech, finance, and consultancy, analyzing and modelling data. I use R, Python and SQL. I also hold a Ph.D. specialized in econometrics, with graduate education in mathematics, during which I developed estimators with high-frequency financial data at a top time-series research center. Before that, I worked with macroeconomic time-series, as well as panel data and program evaluation for causal inference. I have teaching experience and enjoy explaining models, discussing, and finding new ways to explain ideas in a simple manner. I volunteered at Women Who Code.(February 2024 to Present)\n
