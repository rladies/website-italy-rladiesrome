`Time zone changing time` issues can be a major challenge when scheduling events for a global audience. With different time zones, daylight saving time changes, and varying work schedules, it can be difficult to find a time that works for everyone. This can lead to confusion, missed meetings, and frustration for both organizers and attendees. In his talk, Jon Harmon provided valuable insights and practical tips for managing time zones and scheduling events to help overcome these challenges. Attendees learned how to navigate time zone differences, `avoid scheduling conflicts`, and ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to meeting times.
