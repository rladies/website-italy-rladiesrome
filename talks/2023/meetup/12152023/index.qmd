ðŸŽ¬Get ready for a hands-on experience! ðŸ”¥

After two fantastic sessions with data visualization experts, it's time to put your skills into practice! 

During this session, we used the `Gapminder` dataset to produce an insightful `scatterplot.` The entire session was live-coding, providing you with real-time examples and allowing for interactive Q&A. The culmination of our efforts was the creation and release of a PNG, demonstrating the practical application of the concepts covered.
