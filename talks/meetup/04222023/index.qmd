`Registered Attendees (37)` in Partnership with [`R-Ladies NYC`](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-newyork/events/292673996/) `Registered Attendees (39)`

April 2023 speakers are [`Jacqueline Buros`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O_AWJTwAAAAJ&hl=en), experienced in biostatistics and bioinformatics, she is the author of the `survivalstan` package and a contributor to the rstanarm package, and [`Federica Gazzelloni`](https://federicagazzelloni.netlify.app/), independent researcher and statistician, author the `Oregonfrogs` package.

In this talk a deterministic and a Bayesian version of the SIR model is presented.

The `deterministic SIR` model is a mathematical model used to understand the spread of infectious diseases in a population, assuming that the population is homogeneous and the disease spreads at a constant rate. The `Bayesian SIR` model, on the other hand, incorporates uncertainty and variability in the model parameters, allowing for more accurate predictions and better decision-making. It uses Bayesian inference to estimate the probability distribution of the model parameters, given the observed data.
