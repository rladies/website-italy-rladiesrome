On July 22, 2025, **R-Ladies Rome** hosted a talk focused on a key but often overlooked topic: how to communicate health data effectively to the people who need it most—patients. The session was led by [**Dr. Rita Giordano**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritagiordano/), an expert in data visualization and user-centered design.

## 💬 Talk Overview

This session explores how health data can be made truly useful to those navigating diagnoses, treatment options, and care plans. Rita shares real-world examples that highlight the disconnect between how data is typically presented (for researchers and clinicians) and how it could better serve patients themselves.

Through a lens of empathy and inclusion, she invites us to reflect on how scientific and clinical communication can be reimagined to support patient understanding, trust, and agency.
