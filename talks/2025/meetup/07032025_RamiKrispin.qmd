On July 03, 2025, **R-Ladies Rome** hosted a practical and beginner-friendly workshop titled *“Forecasting Time Series with Linear Regression: A Feature-Driven Approach.”* The session was led by [**Rami Krispin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rami-krispin/), author of *Hands-On Time Series Analysis with R* and an expert in time series forecasting at scale.

## 📊 Workshop Overview

This talk explores the fundamentals of time series forecasting using linear regression models. We'll cover how to transform time series data into a supervised learning format and utilize feature engineering techniques to model various components of the series, including trends, seasons, outliers, and structural breaks. This is a beginner-level workshop, and prior knowledge of time series is not needed beyond understanding how linear regression works.
