`Registered Attendees (42)`

On Septembe 29, 2025, **R-Ladies Rome** & **Rome R Users Group** hosted **a software integration example led by Dr. Chuck Huber**, Director of Statistical Outreach at StataCorp and Adjunct Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Texas A&M School of Public Health and at the New York University School of Global Public Health.

##  📊 Talk Overview

We love exploring new ways of working with data, and sometimes that means **stepping outside of R** to see how other tools can connect and enrich our workflows.

While our heart and mission remain with **R**, as data scientists and statisticians we often work in environments where multiple tools coexist. **Understanding how to bridge these ecosystems — R, Python, Stata — helps us collaborate better, think more critically about methodology, and expand our problem-solving toolkit.**

This event is not about selling or promoting software. It’s about learning, sharing knowledge, and keeping our community up-to-date with evolving data science practices.

Whether you're a researcher, designer, or data enthusiast, this recording is packed with practical tools you can adapt immediately.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

In this talk, Dr. Chuck Huber demonstrates how to use Python within Stata, showcasing the seamless integration between these two powerful tools. You'll learn how to:

- Set up and configure Python to work with Stata
- Connect Python with Stata commands and .ado files
- Explore real-world examples of using Python in Stata for data analysis and visualization

By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of how to harness the strengths of both Stata and Python to enhance your data analysis workflows.
