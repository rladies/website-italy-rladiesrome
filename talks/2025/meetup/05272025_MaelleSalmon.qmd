This May, **R-Ladies Rome** hosted a remote session featuring Maëlle Salmon: *“Why Small Git Commits Matter (and How to Make Them!)”*. The talk focused on the why and how of using Git more deliberately—especially the practice of creating small, atomic commits with clear messages.  

Whether you work in code, prose, or both, using Git thoughtfully can transform your workflow—and your collaboration with others.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

In this session, we explored:

- 🧩 Why small, well-labeled commits improve traceability, reduce merge conflicts, and support collaboration
- 🧠 How to structure your work to commit in logical, meaningful units
- 🔧 How to fix and refine commit history with tools like `git commit --amend` and `git rebase`
- 🧪 How to experiment safely using [`saperlipopette`](https://github.com/maelle/saperlipopette), a package for practicing Git workflows in R projects
- 🎤 Bonus Q&A with community tips, questions, and shared real-world use cases

## 🧵 Why This Talk Mattered

At R-Ladies Rome, we’re committed to making tools like Git approachable and useful—especially for data scientists, researchers, and R users in biostatistics, public health, and beyond.

In this session, Maëlle showed us how even small improvements in commit practices can make a big impact: not just in terms of technical tidiness, but in our ability to tell the story of our work. Her message was simple but powerful:

> Git is more than a tool—it’s a practice.

She helped us see version control not as a chore, but as an ally in building reproducible, transparent, and collaborative projects.
