This April 2025, **R-Ladies Rome** hosted a beginner-friendly workshop titled _“From R to Python: A Gentle Introduction”_, designed to help `R` users and beginners take their first steps into the world of `Python.` This hands-on session welcomed attendees from various backgrounds, creating an inclusive and supportive learning space.

Whether you’ve never written a line of Python or you’re just curious how it compares to R, this event aimed to make that transition approachable and fun.

## 💡 What We Covered

During the session, we explored:

- The **similarities and differences** between R and Python 
- How to perform **common data analysis tasks** in Python  
- An introduction to **popular Python libraries** like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `seaborn`  

We also demoed basic workflows, provided a starter script, and answered audience questions live.

## 📊 What You Said

We asked participants three short questions using `Slido.` Here's what they shared:

### 🟣 On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you with programming languages?
