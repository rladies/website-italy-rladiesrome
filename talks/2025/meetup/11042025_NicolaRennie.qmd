On November 2, 2025, `R-Ladies Rome` hosted **Developing Your Data Visualisation Skills in ggplot2**, an engaging and creative session led by [Nicola Rennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io), Data Visualisation Specialist and author of "The Art of Visualization with ggplot2".

## 🐈 Workshop Overview

Nicola walked participants through the entire process of **building a data visualisation in R with ggplot2**, starting from a brand new dataset — the popular [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) cats dataset. Throughout the session, she demonstrated how to explore data, sketch visual ideas, and refine designs to communicate insights clearly and beautifully.

Participants learned how to customise plots with themes, colours, and fonts, transforming simple graphics into polished, publication-ready visualisations.
