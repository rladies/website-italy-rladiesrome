Rome Data Science Networking Event @ INGV
:::

The `Rome data science community` gathered for an unforgettable multilingual evening of code, collaboration, and connection ‚Äîwhere the languages of `R` and `Python` met in harmony. We kicked off the evening with a warm welcome and introduction to `INGV` and `PyData` by [Vincenzo Ventriglia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincenzoventriglia/), who reminded us of the importance of creating spaces where open science, technology, and collaboration intersect. It was the perfect setup for an evening that celebrated the spirit of openness across languages‚Äîspoken and programmed alike.

## üéôÔ∏è Opening Talk

### **[Speaking Many Languages: Finding Power and Joy in R and Python](https://speaking-many-languages.my.canva.site/)**

The keynote by [Federica Gazzelloni](https://federicagazzelloni.com/) set the tone for the evening. With a mix of personal story and technical insight, Federica walked us through her journey from choosing between R and Python to embracing both. She shared how learning to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù more than one programming language helped her grow as a data scientist and opened new doors for collaboration. Her talk included side-by-side code examples in R and Python that sparked lots of follow-up questions and conversation from the crowd‚Äîboth online and in-person.

## ‚ö° Lightning Talks ‚Äì Short, Sharp & Full of Insight

The energy kept flowing with a series of lightning talks, each just 5 minutes long, where community members shared projects, tools, and reflections:

- **[Marco Guerra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFLqT0sAAAAJ&hl=it)** presented "Automatic Detection of Large-Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances using GNSS Data and Image Processing Techniques"
- **[Massimo Viola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/massimo-viola-1a075a1b8/)** shared insights on "A custom TreeQL Python-based Web Service for Database Access"
- **[Federico Palma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palmafederico/)** illustrated "Normalized Semantic Chunker" 
- **[Egon Ferri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egon-ferri/)** closed the session with a thought-provoking reflection on learning curves and language choice titled: "Flying SOLID-ly: Python design principles explained with birds"

## ü´±üèΩü´≤üèø Networking, Connections & Pizza Plans

After the talks, participants stayed to mingle, exchange ideas, and build connections across communities. Many of us continued the evening outside the venue for a multi-community dinner‚Äîa true Roman finale to a collaborative and inspiring meetup.
