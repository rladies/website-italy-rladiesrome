Registered Attendees (65-LinkedIn / 35-Meetup)

[Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-stewart-lowndes/), Director of [NASA-Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/), led an engaging session on the transformative power of forking in open science. This approach, originally from software development, has evolved into a powerful strategy for tackling collaborative challenges in both government and academia.

üé¨ Missed the live session?
Don‚Äôt worry! The recording is now available. Watch it and learn from Julia‚Äôs expertise on how forking as a mindset is reshaping collaboration and innovation in science.

üåü What We Learned

In this session, Julia explained how the concept of forking goes beyond adapting code and has expanded into a worldview that facilitates innovation, credit-sharing, and collective progress. Forking is about adapting resources (like code, documentation, and methodologies) and using them in new, more effective ways while ensuring proper attribution and networking back to the original source.

Key points discussed:

	- Forking as a collaborative tool for the open science community.
	- The role of NASA-Openscapes in helping teams collaborate and adapt workflows, specifically by migrating them to cloud environments.
	- How forking empowers scientists to innovate faster and solve big problems more efficiently through shared resources.
