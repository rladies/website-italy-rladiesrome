On February 16, 2026, **R-Ladies Rome** hosted **From Data to Decisions: Digital Twins for Smarter Maintenance**, a practical session focused on how data science moves beyond notebooks and into real production systems.

The talk presented a physics-informed approach to **Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)** through a real-world aerospace case study. The central question of the session was clear:

> How do we detect failure before it happens — and make decisions that reduce cost and risk?

## 🧩 Tutorial Overview

The session was delivered by **Priyanka Schnell**, Chief Technology Officer at Insurfox. With experience in enterprise-scale digital systems and aerospace manufacturing, Priyanka guided us through how sensor data, physics models, and anomaly detection can work together in production.

The context: robotic drilling in A321 wing assembly. A single snapped drill bit can cause burrs or delamination, potentially scrapping a wing skin valued at €150,000. Traditional maintenance policies replaced drill bits after a fixed number of holes — a strategy that often led to premature replacements or unexpected failures.

Instead of relying on static thresholds, the session introduced a **digital twin** approach.

We explored:

- how high-frequency sensor data (torque, vibration, speed, feed rate) can be transformed into meaningful features  
- why **Specific Cutting Energy** helps detect “wasted energy” before functional failure  
- how regime normalization allows comparison across aluminum and titanium cutting  
- how **Isolation Forest** can identify deviations without labeled failure data  
- why persistence rules (e.g., “6 of 12”) reduce alert noise  
- how early detection within the P–F interval provides actionable lead time  

The session included a live walkthrough in Google Colab using simulated data to demonstrate the workflow step-by-step.

## 🔊 About the Tutorial

This session is part of the **R-Ladies Rome Tutorials** series, which focuses on practical workflows and real-world data applications.

Our goal is to show how data science connects to operational systems — where decisions have financial and technical consequences. We aim to make advanced topics accessible without removing the rigor behind them.
