R is a robust and versatile tool that's tailor-made for statisticians, data analysts, and data scientists like yourself.\n\nIn this recording, we take a deep dive into the capabilities of R, using `insurance data` as our backdrop. We explore how to analyze this data, create visualizations, and take our first steps into the world of modeling, all leading to the production of insightful `reports`.\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q9RGCXw6_c&t=2992s >}}\n\nWhether you're just starting with R or have some prior experience, this second crash course is designed to help you master the fundamentals and unleash the potential of this powerful language.\n\nFeel free to enjoy the recording at your own pace. Pause, rewind, and replay as you delve into the fascinating world of data analysis with R. \n\nIf you have any questions or would like to share your assignments, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at `rome[at]rladies[dot]org`.\n\nFor course materials, you can access them here:\n\n- Material of the course: [--> Go to our Posit.Cloud Workspace](https://posit.cloud/spaces/393298/join?access_code=JBFywQxui8vIu7kP399uv_YsuDnYlrfH-kwgyvLK)\n\n- `{CASdataset}` collection of Insurance datasets: To install the package, simply use the following R code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(timeout = 6000)\ninstall.packages(\"CASdatasets\", \n                 repos = \"http://cas.uqam.ca/pub/\")\nlibrary(CASdataset)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also recommended the book `\"Statistical Foundations of Actuarial Learning and its Applications\"` by M. V. Wüthrich and M. Merz for Actuarial investigations.\n\nTo get more familiar with Posit.Cloud, check out the `Posit Cloud Essentials series` [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fzwm4ZhVQQ)).\n\nWe used Posit.Cloud for this course, but if you prefer to `install R` directly on your machine, you can follow the instructions [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).\n\nFor `additional help and resources`, don't forget to explore the `R4DS community` at <https://www.rfordatasci.com/> and read the `R for Data Science - R4DS Book` by Hadley Wickham [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/].\n\n\nFor those starting with R, have a look at our previous course: [Mastering R: An Intensive Crash Course for Data Enthusiasts!](https://rladiesrome.quarto.pub/website/talks/2023/meetup/07272023/)\n\n\n> Enjoy your journey with R, and happy data analyzing!\n\n#RCrash | #rstats | #tidyverse | #KnowledgeSharing | #opensource | #onlinelearning | #RStudio | #PositCloud\n\n<center>[← Previous event](/talks/2023/meetup/08282023/index.qmd) | [Next event →](/talks/2023/meetup/10272023/index.qmd)</center>",
