We are excited to announce that `R-Ladies Rome` has expanded its online presence by opening social accounts on `Twitter`, `LinkedIn`, and `Mastodon`.

As a local chapter of R-Ladies Global, our mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community and provide a safe and supportive space for minority gender R enthusiasts to learn, grow, and contribute to the R community.

With our new social media accounts, we hope to connect with more people interested in working with R, share our events and activities, and engage with the larger R community.

`Follow us` on `Twitter at @rladiesrome`, connect with us on `LinkedIn at @R-Ladies Rome`, and join us on `Mastodon at @rladiesrome@fosstodon.org` to stay up to date with our latest news and events.
