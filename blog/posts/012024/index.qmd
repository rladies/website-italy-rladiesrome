### A Year of Diversity and Inclusion

One of our primary goals at R-Ladies Rome is to foster an inclusive environment.

```

## Rate of Change

To calculate the rate of change consider the initial and final values, and the formula for percentage change is:

$$\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right) \times 100$$

### Tech Talks and Workshops

Our calendar was packed with enlightening tech talks and hands-on workshops. Renowned speakers and experts shared their knowledge on data visualization, statistics, and R programming. These events not only provided valuable insights but also showcased the vast possibilities that technology offers.

### Data Visualization Month

November was an exciting month as we delved deep into the world of data visualization. With two remarkable events featuring experts like CÃ©dric Scherer and Cara Thompson, we explored the art and science of transforming data stories into engaging visual narratives. The live-coding sessions and Q&A interactions made this month a highlight of our year.

        legend.direction = "horizontal")
```


### Empowering Women in Tech

Empowering women in technology has been a core focus for R-Ladies Rome. We organized events specifically designed to support and uplift women in the tech field. From networking sessions to skill showcases, these gatherings aimed to create a supportive community for women in various tech-related professions.



### Looking Forward to 2024

As we close the chapter on 2023, we're excited about the possibilities that 2024 holds. With a commitment to continuous learning, collaboration, and empowerment, R-Ladies Rome is poised to embark on another year of growth and impact.
