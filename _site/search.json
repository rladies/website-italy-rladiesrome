We have had the pleasure of hosting amazing speakers who have shared their knowledge and insights on various topics related to R programming.\nJulia Silge kicked off the year with a talk on MLOps with Vetiver, followed by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel’s presentation on RLadies Quarto. Isabella Velasquez then shared with us What's new in the tidyverse, and Jacqueline Buros and Federica Gazzelloni wrapped up the series with a talk on Modeling infectious diseases.\nAnd we are excited to add a man to our list Jon Harmon who talked us about time zone adjustments with Why I Hate Summer Time: Coordinating a Global Community of Learners. Finally, our first half of the year concludes with the latest events Data Science Best Practices featuring Dr. Simina Boca and One Health and the Politics of Coronaviruses with Dr. Laura Kahn.\nWe are grateful to all our speakers for sharing their expertise, and to our community for their engagement and support. If you missed any of these talks, you can find the presentation materials on our website or ask for more information at rome@rladies.org.

It was developed by Hadley Wickham and his team at RStudio, and it includes packages for data manipulation, visualization, modeling, and programming.\nThe tidyverse emphasizes a consistent and intuitive syntax, making it easier for users to work with data and create reproducible analyses. Some of the most popular packages in the tidyverse include dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, and purrr. Overall, the tidyverse has become a widely-used and powerful tool for data scientists and analysts working with R.\nMaterial of the talk: Whats New in the Tidyverse\nTo follow Isabella Velasquez:\n\nWebSite/Blog: https://ivelasq.rbind.io/\nGitHub: https://github.com/ivelasq\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ivelasq3\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivelasq/\nMastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@ivelasq3"

The Bayesian SIR model, on the other hand, incorporates uncertainty and variability in the model parameters, allowing for more accurate predictions and better decision-making. It uses Bayesian inference to estimate the probability distribution of the model parameters, given the observed data.\nMaterial of the talk:\n\ndeterministic-sir-model-with-r\nr-ladies-sir-model"
