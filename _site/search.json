The ability to prepare data—transforming it from raw, messy formats into clean and structured datasets—is fundamental for extracting meaningful insights and making data-driven decisions. Without proper data preparation, even the most sophisticated models will produce unreliable results.\n\nData wrangling typically involves\n\nCleaning: Identifying and dealing with missing, inconsistent, or duplicate data.\nManipulating: Filtering, selecting, and summarizing data to focus on relevant information.\nTransforming: Reshaping datasets into a format that is ideal for analysis or visualization.\n\nThe Data Wrangling with R tutorial was designed to introduce participants to these concepts, with a particular focus on using the tidyverse packages, which are essential for efficient data manipulation in R. Whether you’re new to R or looking to enhance your existing skills, this session covered everything you need to get started with data wrangling.\n\n\nKey Takeaways from the Session\n\nTidyverse Essentials: We explored the tidyverse suite, including key packages like dplyr, tidyr, and readr. These tools streamline the process of reading, cleaning, and transforming data, making them indispensable for any data project.\nData Import: Participants learned how to import datasets from various formats, such as CSV and Excel files, and gained tips on exploring the structure of their data using glimpse(), summary(), and other base R functions.\nData Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing data and ensuring consistency in data types were thoroughly demonstrated. We practiced using filter(), mutate(), and other functions from the dplyr package to clean datasets.\nData Transformation: From reshaping data with pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() to joining multiple datasets with left_join() and inner_join(), the session provided a comprehensive look at transforming messy data into a tidy format.\n\n\n\nMaterial of the Talk\n\nChapter Intro Presentation: https://rladiesrome.quarto.pub/september302024\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/20240930-DWPwR\nTutorial Website: https://rladiesrome.quarto.pub/data-wrangling-practice-with-r/\n\n\n\nMore Resources\n\nCardiovascular Disease Dataset on Kaggle\nIHME website\nR for Data Science by Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G.

The Bayesian SIR model, on the other hand, incorporates uncertainty and variability in the model parameters, allowing for more accurate predictions and better decision-making. It uses Bayesian inference to estimate the probability distribution of the model parameters, given the observed data.\nMaterial of the talk:\n\ndeterministic-sir-model-with-r\nr-ladies-sir-model\n\n\n← Previous event | Next event →\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The live-coding sessions and Q&A interactions made this month a highlight of our year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpowering Women in Tech\nEmpowering women in technology has been a core focus for R-Ladies Rome. We organized events specifically designed to support and uplift women in the tech field. From networking sessions to skill showcases, these gatherings aimed to create a supportive community for women in various tech-related professions.\nLooking Forward to 2024\nAs we close the chapter on 2023, we’re excited about the possibilities that 2024 holds. With a commitment to continuous learning, collaboration, and empowerment, R-Ladies Rome is poised to embark on another year of growth and impact.\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "We are thrilled to look back at the first half of the year and share the exciting talks that R-Ladies Rome has hosted. It has been an incredible journey, filled with amazing speakers who have shared their knowledge and insights on various topics related to R programming.\nThe year kicked off with Julia Silge’s captivating talk on MLOps with Vetiver, followed by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel’s informative presentation on RLadies Quarto. Isabella Velasquez then took the stage and shared with us What’s new in the tidyverse. Our series of inspiring talks continued with Jacqueline Buros and Federica Gazzelloni wrapping up the initial set of events with a thought-provoking discussion on Deterministic modeling of infectious diseases and Bayesian modeling of infectious diseases.\nAs we continued to grow, we were excited to welcome Jon Harmon, the first male speaker, who engaged us with his talk on time zone adjustments and his insightful presentation titled “Why I Hate Summer Time: Coordinating a Global Community of Learners.”\nBut we didn’t stop there! The first half of the year concluded with two more exciting events. We had the privilege of hosting Dr. Simina Boca, who shared her expertise on Data Science Best Practices. Additionally, Dr. Laura Kahn enlightened us with her talk on “One Health and the Politics of Coronaviruses.”\nWe are incredibly grateful to all our speakers for their passion and dedication in sharing their expertise with our community. Their talks have enriched our knowledge and inspired us to continue exploring the vast world of R programming.\nTo those who missed any of these enlightening talks, fear not! You can find the presentation materials on our website. If you have any inquiries or want more information, don’t hesitate to reach out to us at rome@rladies.org.\nThe first half of the year has been phenomenal, but we are just getting started!
